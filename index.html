Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before. I don't wanna be you anymore. Hands, hands getting cold. Losing feeling's getting old. Was I made from a broken mold ? Hurt, I can't shake. We've made every mistake. Only you know the way that I break. If teardrops could be bottled. There'd be swimming pools filled by models. Told that tight dress is what makes you a whore.
